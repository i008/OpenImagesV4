# OpenImagesV4 Bounding Box Subset. 

#### Download the *small* OpenImagesV4 dataset

This is a reduced version of the original 500gb dataset. In the small version i sampled 5000 train images and 500 train/val images.
This should be a handy drop-in replacement to create a dev environment and test stuff out.

Be aware that is is a random sample so it might happen that it does not reflect the original dataset distribition. And it might not contain all the labels!
